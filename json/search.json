However, what really ruined the evening was the incredibly rude staff member.  We were waiting for our bill for quite some time.  I asked other staff members to grab our waitress and ask for our bill - which they just basically ignored.  I said I would ask myself - and then the one staff member made really rude comments about me just loud enough so I could hear.  I had not been rude - we just had to leave.  It was totally not called for.  Will never go to this restaurant again and would not recommend.  When you are spending a lot of money for a night out - the staff should have the decency to be polite.",

I found this rather odd, and I came away from the restaurant feeling disappointed with our experience.",

He had a great staff to support him in looking after our birthday cup cakes and assisting with the delivery of our orders.  Service was slightly slow but it was totally understandable - I could not believe that almost every seat was taken.  We were served in reasonable time for our group size.  It was a full variety of good things ordered both food and drink.  We were looked after very well and many thoughtful assists with our needs and wants.  The food was very good and on the whole, the evening worked out very well.\nWe will certainly return and we have been there on a few occasions in the past and always found our experiences to be enjoyable.  In the summer, the patio is great.\nThanks to Alex and the management and staff.",

    "reviewTitle": "Chaos (and bad food)",
    "reviewText": "I was looking forward to meeting friends for the first time in ages (because of Covid), but the evening could have been better.\n\nThe patio of the Amsterdam Brew House is nice and the staff was friendly.  But overall there are more thumbs down than ups.  The worst part of the evening was a party on the upper level.  I was told that there was a reservation for 40 people, but more than 80 showed up.  For much of the evening people were screaming out the windows like lunatics.  This went on for a long while.  Eventually someone at a table near me had had enough and went upstairs and he was able to get the mob to shut up.  That’s really the responsibility of the manager and the staff, but they did absolutely nothing.\n\nOther points were lost because of the food.  I ordered a chicken dish that was unbelievably bland and boring.  Imagine a chicken breast boiled in water for a few minutes, thrown on a plate and then covered in grated cabbage.  Not good.\n\nAlso, if you go on the Amsterdam’s official webpage there a special section for “Safety Protocols.”  A dozen different points are listed in terms of how the Amsterdam is making diners feel safe (even if Covid is on the downswing).  The Amsterdam really needs to update this page (or remove it) because I don’t think it was following a single one of its twelve points.\n\nFinally, the Amsterdam has a real mouse problem.  They were running around all over the place outside (including on the seats).  I’ve never seen that at a restaurant.\n\nSo a real let down, especially in terms of the screaming customers and the boring food.",

The service was pleasant enough but the server probably had too many tables to look after.  What’s surely important in all restaurants should be the food! And this is where the last few restaurants we have visited have missed their point !! And Amsterdam fell into the same category  !! The beer is great but the food needs to be excellent !! Each dish missed the mark in some way ….. interesting that none of the group said they would return. Owners and managers need to critic the offer and make sure it’s a good as possible - or at least that it meets their expectations. So ….. go for the beer and patios …… skip the food.

I love pizza, and was looking forward to trying it when she told me it was one of her two favourite things on the menu.  If you like sweet sauce that has so much garlic in it that it’s just about the only flavour profile you can taste on the pizza this dish is for you.  It tasted like canned sauce with a bulb of crushed raw garlic added to it.  In addition, I’m not sure what was going on with our order but everyone that came in after us had their meals, and we still waited another twenty minutes.  Fortunately we weren’t in a hurry, but this simply should not happen.  I will go back to the Amsterdam Barrel House in future, but I will steer clear of the awful pizza.",

A bit too brightly lit for an evening visit. Went there for a Jay's game and it was not the best for viewing the game for everyone that was in our party. TV's where too small for the distance we were sitting.\n\nThe service was fantastic though!",

David came to cook for us at our house and provided a 5 Star experience from the moment he arrived! He was flexible, explained everything as he cooked and prepared, answered our many questions and just created a night to remember with unforgettable food! When planning the evening, David was incredibly responsive and accommodating to dietary needs! I can not speak higher of our experience with David and can't wait to continue following him through his culinary journey! Thank you David and we will see you soon!",

    "reviewText": "We had a charming, intimate dinner at Drifter's Solace last night.  The venue, among the wine stacks of Grand Cru Deli, hardly feels like a restaurant, with fewer than a dozen diners at a time.  It's as if you happened to know an incredibly accomplished chef who offered to serve you a seven course dinner in a wine shop after hours.  The service is friendly, casual but precise and attentive.  And over the next three hours, the seven courses of the testing menu arrive, delivered by Chef David Salt, who visits each table to offer his work.  Fabulous small dishes with the freshest ingredients, beautifully presented.  The fried chicken and matsutake mushroom dish was a discovery.  The truffle cavatelli, my favourite.  The foie gras, a show stopper; the cold turbot confit, a rare and precious dish. I won't spoil the rest. Overall, the menu was well balanced and ultimately very abundant without being too heavy.  The wine pairings we had were on the lighter side, with many white wines -- to my taste, well chosen to complement the extraordinary dinner.  Drifter's Solace is not for every day (and priced accordingly) and not the venue to see and be seen.  But I would be delighted to go again for another celebratory dinner because it is memorably excellent and welcoming.",

Dave put together the perfect meal, and I was able to combine his Sommelier’s wine pairings with some of my own bottles (very appropriate corkage fee). We had the whole space to ourselves for the night, Dave’s overview and breakdown of each dish (he even gave away some secrets) and we were served and waited over in luxury by a sommelier who will explain every wine and pairing to you.\n\nIt was the perfect setting for such this special milestone. Will have to find another reason to visit!",

From the moment we walked in We were treated like royalty and all of us have been to some of the top restaurants in the city. The food, the ambience the people that served us made us all feel unbelievable the way they accommodated each person‘s food, allergies, etc. unbelievable this will be our new home whether it’s for an event or just on a regular basis I cannot talk highly enough about everything unbelievable bravo thank you to everybody in the restaurant You guys all knocked it out of the ballpark. I highly recommend Piano Piano on Mount Pleasant to everyone outstanding five stars and maybe an extra couple.",

He is incredibly professional and attentive, and also one of the kindest and most genuine humans we have ever met in the fine dining world.\n\nFine dining with zero judgment and complete warmth is a dream. Michael made us feel so welcome and comfortable from the very first moment. I did not enjoy my initial dish and he handled it with such grace and positivity, happily helping me choose something I would truly enjoy. His warmth, patience, and bright energy were a breath of fresh air.\n\nBecause of him, the experience felt absolutely magical. The beautifully plated food, the lovely ambiance, and service that goes above and beyond. Everything was perfect.\n\nWe are definitely 1000% going back soon. Thank you, Michael, for making our special day even more special. 💙✨",

My concern with today’s visit was the way they advertise their “Pre Fixe” luncheon menu for $34.  Anytime I have had a “Pre-Fixe” menu it is Appetizer, Main and Dessert.  In this case, it is only the Appetizer and Main.  Dessert is not included (but is on the “Pre Fixe” menu card for an additional $6 each in teeney weeney print).  For 2 people it was an additional $20 which we thought was included in the $34 cost. Anyway, servers should make the client aware since this is not the usual way to offer a Pre-Fixe menu.",

    "reviewText": "I have been visiting this Nespresso location for several years. I am a fan of Nespresso coffee and their products, and the quality of their espresso has always been consistent. The store is clean, well organized, and the products are displayed in a simple and uncluttered way.\n\nMy concern is with the customer service model. Purchasing coffee is entirely self service, including payment, and the sales associates usually remain behind the counter. During my most recent visit, I spent time browsing the machines because I am looking to upgrade. I was the only customer in the store, yet none of the associates approached me or offered assistance. They were engaged in conversation among themselves instead. It felt like a missed opportunity to highlight their products or answer questions.\n\nI have also noticed that I am never greeted when I walk in. This makes me wonder why staff remain behind the counter instead of engaging with customers on the floor. If the experience is going to be fully self service, it raises the question of whether the store needs staff at all if the human touch is not part of the experience.\n\nOverall, I still appreciate the brand and the product quality, but I hope this location improves its approach to customer engagement.",

Thanks to his friendly and thoughtful service, our first purchase felt truly special and happy.

    "reviewText": "The service process at this store requires improvement. While waiting at the front of the line, an individual from the back bypassed the queue and was assisted immediately, despite others waiting. This resulted in additional delays for those who had followed the line properly.\n\nWhen it was finally my turn, the associate attempted to process my checkout without allowing me to ask questions about products, even though the area is designated for customer assistance rather than self-checkout. Responses to my inquiries felt rushed, and overall, the level of support seemed inconsistent depending on the type of purchase being made.\n\nI recommend implementing a clearer queue management system and ensuring associates provide consistent, attentive service to all customers during busy periods.",

    "reviewText": "I had a very disappointing experience with the customer service at this location. I got in line to order a few coffee pods, and while the employee behind the counter had just finished with the previous customer, she was intentionally acting busy, giving me side eyes instead of acknowledging me. There was no greeting, no \"How can I help you?\"—nothing. She just stared at me until, after about a minute, I had to ask if she was ready to take my order. Unfortunately, her attitude remained unprofessional throughout the entire interaction.\n\nIt would be helpful if staff wore name tags so they could be easily identified. I understand that everyone has tough days, especially after dealing with difficult customers, but basic courtesy should always be a priority. Management should consider hiring staff who are at least as nice as the store itself.",

    "reviewText": "Worst Nespresso ever.\n\nToday my friend and I came to this store to buy several sleeves of capsules, and the service was terrible. First of all, the queue signage was very unclear—we couldn’t tell which line was for what. Despite the store being so large, there was only one cashier. After we queued behind another customer, we were rudely told to go line up somewhere else.\n\nAfter purchasing, we wanted to try some new flavors at the bar area. We sat there for nearly ten minutes, and although the staff saw us, they completely ignored us. We had to approach an employee ourselves and explained twice what we wanted. After going back and forth without giving us a clear answer, she impatiently told us to join the cashier line because she was serving other customers. But there were no other customers at that moment, and there was no explanation why tasting required queuing at the cashier.\n\nOverall, it was an extremely unpleasant experience. If the Yorkdale location had been open, we would never have come here.",

    "reviewText": "I brought my husband to BlueBlood for his 33rd birthday and, although I rarely leave reviews, felt compelled to write a lengthy review an entire week later due to our strange and unsettling experience.\n\nUpon arriving for our 9:00 dinner reservation, we were told that our table wasn't ready because the party currently seated were \"still finishing dessert\". We were directed to the bar where we proceeded to order cocktails. I ordered the \"Once Upon a Time\" and the bartender paused before asking me if I like an old fashioned. I love them which is precisely why I ordered the drink, so I replied \"yes\". I considered that others may have ordered it simply because of the name without reading the description, but felt as though my drink choice was being questioned and can't help but wonder if my husband's taste preference would have been questioned had he ordered the same spirit-forward cocktail for himself. It took at least 20 minutes to get our drinks and and I believe we were finally seated at around 9:45 PM.\n\nUpon being seated at our table, I had chosen the lobster bisque as my appetizer but before I had the chance to order my main course, the server interrupted me to provide an in-depth explanation of what lobster bisque is. I appreciate when servers take the time to provide a more detailed description of the menu items and how the chef prepares them but being that lobster bisque isn't an exotic dish by any means, it seemed as though he assumed I didn't know what I was ordering. I also speak French and certainly did not mispronounce \"bisque\" to give him that impression. I wanted to politely say \"I am aware of what lobster bisque is, thank you\", but couldn't get a word in and was too stunned to speak.\n\nI adore fine dining and this is the first time in my life where I've had restaurant staff treat me as though I'm uneducated and incompetent... And this happened twice within the first hour of being there. A simple \"yes, ma'am\" without the preconceived commentary would have sufficed in both situations. Perhaps it was our age (we seemed to be quite a bit younger than other guests seated nearby) but I couldn't help but find the interactions to be rather insulting and condescending.\n\nThe ambiance was lovely and unique, the cocktails were fantastic (one of the best I've had), and the sea bass was delicious; However, the rest of the food was forgettable, the staff were unwelcoming, the service was slow, and we felt neglected as our server rarely came by our table. After setting down our main courses, the server immediately walked away before I had a chance to request a glass of wine. My husband was fortunate in that he had already requested that a glass of wine be brought alongside his main course when he ordered. I don't eat red meat but my husband said the steak was nothing special, and the lobster bisque was terribly bland. The establishment is aesthetically beautiful and our food consisted of high-quality ingredients, but the flavour and service are severely lacking.\n\nI have been fortunate enough to dine at several Michelin Star establishments and the service here is atrocious by comparison. We expect good service at a \"refined dining experience\" and wanted to love BlueBlood, but we would not return. Unfortunately, I feel as though I paid to eat inside a castle and nothing more, and I'm sad that my husband's birthday dinner was so disappointing. I sincerely regret not just paying to visit the museum portion of Casa Loma and going to The Keg Mansion for comparable food and better hospitality.\n\nI hate to see hard-working people waste their money and businesses who take advantage of consumers by underdelivering on quality for what they charge are beyond offensive to me. I'll happily spend $20 on a fast food meal or $2,000 on a luxury dining experience if I feel the cost is justified; It's about matching your product to the price and this place is not it. (Tip: If you love an old fashioned AND great service, we recommend trying Canoe - their brown butter apple old fashioned is exceptional).",

From the moment we stepped inside, we were struck by the sophisticated atmosphere, with service standards that easily rival the best Michelin-starred restaurants we've encountered in Europe.\nThe kitchen here is outstanding, with each dish showcasing absolutely fresh, high-quality ingredients prepared with evident care and thought. We savored every bite. The restaurant's design is also remarkable, creating a space that feels both elegant and welcoming.\nOur experience was made even more special by the wonderful service. We were particularly impressed by Oxana, the manager, who greeted us warmly and took the time for a personal tour, a lovely touch that made us feel truly valued as guests. The entire staff was incredibly attentive and friendly, and their wine pairing suggestions were spot on, enhancing our meal perfectly. The overall atmosphere was inviting and convivial, exactly what we hoped for on our date night.\nLocated in the heart of downtown Toronto, Convivium Dining Community is a fantastic choice for a special occasion or anyone seeking a top-tier dining experience. It's clear why they are so popular – we highly recommend booking a table and look forward to returning ourselves. As very grateful guests, we wish Convivium Dining Community continued success!",
